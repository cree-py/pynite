# Welcome to the pynite Docs!

### Introduction
Welcome to PyNite™! PyNite is an asynchronous Python wrapper for the [Fortnite Tracker Network](https://fortnitetracker.com). The wrapper is currently in progress, meaning we are **currently** developing more wrapper classes, but for now, all the data from FTN should be accessible to you, albeit in a more difficult manner.

### Installation
PyNite is available through `pip`.
#### To install:
```pip install pynite```

This should install PyNite along with its dependencies. If for some reason the dependencies are not installed, PyNite will not work correctly. You can manually install the dependencies through
```pip install aiohttp```
and
```pip install python-box```

You can update PyNite by running ```pip install -U pynite```. The current stable version is `1.1.5`.

PyNite requires Python 3.6 or later versions.
